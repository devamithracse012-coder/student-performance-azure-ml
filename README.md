- Azure ML Designer
- Linear Regression Model
- CSV Dataset (Student Performance)

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Age
- Gender
- School type
- Parent education
- Study time
- Attendance
- Internet access
- Subject scores (Math, Science)

## 🔁 ML Pipeline Steps
1. Dataset uploaded to Azure ML Workspace
2. Data preprocessing using Select Columns
3. Train-test split
4. Linear Regression model training
5. Model evaluation inside Azure ML Designer

## ✅ Execution Status
- Pipeline executed successfully
- Job status: **Completed**
- Outputs visualized inside Azure ML Designer

> ⚠️ Note: Azure ML Designer pipelines require authenticated Azure access.  
> This pipeline cannot be executed outside the Azure portal.
